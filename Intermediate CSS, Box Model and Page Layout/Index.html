<p>The study of Computer Information Systems (CIS) focuses on the practical applications of computer technology through the study of a broad range of subjects. Professionals in this field may have knowledge and expertise in topics such as software design, communications or business. 
They are the experts to turn to when it comes to applying technology to business applications. </p>

I decided to major in CIS because it got my attention when my brother introduced this field of study to me when he graduated. I was impressed how technology can advance society and how programming can be challenging but at the same time interesting. 
I like the idea of dealing with computers and trying to understand its language. For me to be able to create a program or solve a computer problem can be an accomplishment feeling.
