<p>Business analysts are responsible for bridging the gap between IT and the business using data analytics 
to assess processes, determine requirements and deliver data-driven recommendations and reports to executives and stakeholders.
<br />
The business analyst position requires both hard skills and soft skills. Business analysts need to know how to pull, analyze and report 
data trends, and be able to share that information with others and apply it on the business side. Not all business analysts need a background 
in IT as long as they have a general understanding of how systems, products and tools work. Alternatively, some business analysts have a 
strong IT background and less experience in business, and are interested in shifting away from IT to this hybrid role.
