<h1>1 Hour Trekking!</h1>


<p>

It was my first time doing trekking and it was one of the best highlights of my trip to the Philippines. 
Even though I was born in the Philippines, I did not see the whole beauty of my motherland. 
I grew up in the province and I did not have the chance to go around the beautiful places in the Philippines. 
I went home last year for two weeks and made sure to visit some of the top places in the Philippines. <br>

One of the relaxing waterfalls in San Luis, Aurora is the Ditumabo Motherfalls. 
This is one of the "must visit" places when you visit Baler, Aurora.  
It was an hour trekking and I must tell you, once you reach the waterfalls, 
it was all worth it! The weather in the Philippines is always humid, and with an hour trekking, 
you will sweat a lot especially when you go during summer. 
Don't worry! All that sweat will go away because the water temperature of the motherfalls is really cold 
(the best feeling though for this weather).
 After soaking in the cold water for a couple of minutes, everything was so relaxing. Just feel the water, air, 
 and birds singing around the tall trees. <br><br>
