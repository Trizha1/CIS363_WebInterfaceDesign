<u><i><b>My Experience...</b></i></u> <br>

If you are one of those people who dare to face your fears and are adventurous, 
then this is for you! I encountered and learned a lot in this adventure and 
I must say that I faced a lot of my fears here. I also realized a lot of things like 
"I can't believe I did that..." 
I discovered so much about myself. 
<br><br>

Our trip began at the starting point where we put on our gear (helmets, life vests, and trekking shoes).
Then, since we are group of 6, two tour guides accompanied us to our trip. 
A motorbike ride drove us at the jump off point. We walked about 15-30 mins before the fun jumping began. 
Since the weather in the Philippines is hot and humid, they provided umbrellas while we walked. 
<br><br>

As we go down the path, we heard birds singing and the waterfalls kind of like a jungle sound. 
There are 6 mandatory jumps for downstream, the first one is about 20 ft or so. 
There are some alternative ways for some people who were scared to jump. <br><br>

<br><br>
There are 3 high jumps that are on the course. 1 is required the other 2 is optional. The first one is the required one.
<br>
After the first jump, we swam about 10-15 mins more to get to the next jumping point.
 The water felt fresh and relaxing to the point where you just want to lay down and relax. <br>
The next one was not jumping but sliding! We had to slide down a mini waterfall. <br>

We had to swim, climb up and down to get to the destination. 
It might be exhausting since we were dealing with slippery rocks, 
but hey now comes the best part of the adventure! Eating!!!<br>
But one of my favorites was the swing!<br><br>

<br><br>
After the swing, the biggest jump came and it is about 55 ft high. 
We did not do this one since we were running out of time to go to our next destination. 
Also, I know I would take my time praying and doubting if I can jump that high. 
The adventure lasted about 3-4 hours depending on how much time you spend on the activities. 
This was a very fun experience and I would love to do it again!
